Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, is a condition characterized by the accumulation of 
fat in the liver. It is a common liver disorder and can be caused by various factors, including alcohol 
consumption, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and certain medications.
There are two main types of fatty liver disease:
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This is the most common form of fatty liver disease and occurs 
in individuals who do not consume excessive alcohol. NAFLD is often associated with obesity, insulin 
resistance, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.
Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD): AFLD is caused by excessive alcohol consumption over a prolonged 
period. Alcohol is toxic to liver cells and can lead to inflammation and fat accumulation in the liver. If 
alcohol consumption continues, it can progress to more severe forms of liver disease, such as alcoholic 
hepatitis or cirrhosis.
Symptoms of fatty liver disease may be absent or mild in the early stages. However, as the condition 
progresses, some people may experience fatigue, weakness, abdominal discomfort, and enlargement of 
the liver. If left untreated, fatty liver disease can lead to complications such as liver inflammation 
(steatohepatitis), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of liver cancer.
Diagnosis of fatty liver disease involves a combination of medical history assessment, physical 
examination, blood tests (to assess liver function and rule out other causes), and imaging studies such as 
ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. In some cases, a liver biopsy may be performed to assess the severity of 
liver damage.-
